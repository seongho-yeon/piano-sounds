Files can be accessed directly like so:

https://ledlamp.github.io/piano-sounds/GreatAndSoftPiano/a0.mp3

Tip: Fork this repository if you want to hotlink these sounds, in case this repository changes.

Most of these sounds came from electrashave at http://files.meowbin.com/Sounds. GreatAndSoftPiano, HardAndToughPiano, and LoudAndProudPiano were obtained from Yoshify by FireController1847.


### From here, my additional notes.
In order to transform mp3 file to wav file, you can run generate_wave.sh inside the folder including the mp3 files.
